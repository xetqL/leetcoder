# Leetcoder
This repository aims at providing a solution to leetcode problems in rust

The goal is to provide easy and reproducible solutions with (hopefully) 
rationale and help for each problem.

Each problem is solved using zero dependency. 

Only test string are possibly parsed via serde/serde-json.

Each binary is named after the leetcode problem name:
E.g., to run missing number problem:
`cargo run --bin missing-numbers`
